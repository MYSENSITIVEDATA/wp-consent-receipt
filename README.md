# WP Consent Receipt
A Consent Receipt plugin for Wordpress 

The WP Consent Receipt plugin can be called from themes and other plugins via the wp_consent_receipt_button filter hook: 

```php
if (has_filter('wp_consent_receipt_button')) {
	$html = apply_filters('wp_consent_receipt_button', $html, $consentReceiptData);
}
```

Example data for the $consentReceiptData associative array:

```php
